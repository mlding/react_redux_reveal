##  virtual-dom

- for every DOM object, there is a corresponding "virtual DOM object.". A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real thing's power to directly change what's on the screen.

- Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster.
